    the idea
        *plugin style:: 
			ofcourse that we can load all plugins, but we do not have to do that
				--it is in the middle of all-in-one and each-one-proj
			minimal effort to run and intergrate codes
				1.copy files 
				2.click to run 
			full-content in usb stick 
			each proj is resbonsible for itself, but easy to use sth. in common 
			implement::
				in vs, use "set as start-up project" 
				in xcode, use "group " -lev2
				in eclipse, use "package"
				in ubuntu, bare projs, use "Makefile" -lev2
        all-in-one or plugin??
            all-in-one too large
            each algo per proj too small 
            *plugin style -stay in the middle of them!!!
        plugin style? (scalable?) easy to combine? 
            1.xxx name style -no
            2.two algos(or more) in one proj
                backup multiple files easy 
                import easy ：：
                    minimal change to start a new algo with diff. dependcies 
                    minimal effort to intergrate a new method (multiple files )
                two main files can load at the same time 
    needed
